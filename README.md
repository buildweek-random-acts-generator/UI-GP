Proposal
<br>

- What problem does your app solve?

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

    Random acts generator solves both problems by reminding you to serve- randomly choosing a person from your contacts, and giving you suggestions for how to serve them.

- What is the mission statement?

    Our mission is to connect people one random act of kindness at a time. We strive to facilitate acts of kindness no matter where you are or how much you can contribute. We strive to provide a supportive community of individuals with the ideas and means to make change in the world regardless of who you are or where you live.

For Data Scientists
<br>


- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app
<br>

Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

    Busy young professionals
    Mid 20’s
    College students
    
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
    
    They want tasks they can complete remotely and tasks that aren’t too specific. They had a preference for writing tasks such as texting or sharing messages from their phone.  

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
  
    Some validation has occurred through sending out surveys.  Also some user testing has occurred through showing our user group a prototype for onboarding, adding contacts, and adding service ideas.  So far, the users have successfully completed the tasks and further testing will occur. 

<br>
Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

<br>
  Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
